# GenAI Interview Problems

A compact set of interview-style problems focused on GenAI systems, Python concurrency/data structures, and system design discussions.

## What is in this repo

- `*.md` + `*.py` pairs for coding exercises (some Python files are starter stubs).
- `OOP/` for object-oriented design and concurrency-style prompts.
- `algo/` for algorithm practice notebooks.
- `sys_design/` for system design interview prompts.
- `test_task_dependency_problem.py` for validating task dependency ordering logic.

## Quick start

1. Pick a problem from a markdown file.
2. Implement the solution in the corresponding Python file (or your own file).
3. Run solution to prove

## Goal

Use this repo to practice interview problem solving with clear trade-offs, correctness, and explainable design decisions.
