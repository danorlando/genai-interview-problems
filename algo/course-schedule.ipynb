    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a total of `num_courses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `num_courses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must take course `bi` before course `ai`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return **the ordering of courses** you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it's impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Input: num_courses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]\n",
    "Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]\n",
    "Explanation: There are 4 courses. Course 1 and 2 require course 0. Course 3 requires both 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "Input: num_courses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]\n",
    "Output: [0,1]\n",
    "Explanation: Take course 0 first, then course 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "Input: num_courses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]\n",
    "Output: []\n",
    "Explanation: Circular dependency - impossible to complete all courses.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= num_courses <= 2000`\n",
    "- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= num_courses * (num_courses - 1)`\n",
    "- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`\n",
    "- `0 <= ai, bi < num_courses`\n",
    "- `ai != bi`\n",
    "- All pairs `[ai, bi]` are distinct\n",
    "\n",
    "## GenAI Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is similar to dependency resolution in ML pipeline orchestration (Airflow, Kubeflow) or determining the order of model training steps in multi-stage training pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Hint 1</summary>\n",
    "This is a classic topological sorting problem. The courses are nodes and prerequisites are directed edges.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Hint 2</summary>\n",
    "You can use either DFS (with cycle detection) or BFS (Kahn's algorithm with in-degree tracking).\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Hint 3</summary>\n",
    "For BFS approach: Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree = 0). After taking a course, reduce the in-degree of dependent courses.\n",

    "This is a graph problem where each course is a node. The graph is directional where prerequisites point to the courses that depend on them. Since we have to find a valid ordering, it might make sense to use DFS to solve. \n",
