    "\n",
    "## Difficulty: Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an `m x n` grid where each cell can have one of three values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `0` representing an empty cell\n",
    "- `1` representing a fresh orange\n",
    "- `2` representing a rotten orange\n",
    "\n",
    "Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **minimum number of minutes** that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Minute 0: [[2,1,1],\n",
    "           [1,1,0],\n",
    "           [0,1,1]]\n",
    "Minute 1: [[2,2,1],\n",
    "           [2,1,0],\n",
    "           [0,1,1]]\n",
    "Minute 2: [[2,2,2],\n",
    "           [2,2,0],\n",
    "           [0,1,1]]\n",
    "Minute 3: [[2,2,2],\n",
    "           [2,2,0],\n",
    "           [0,2,1]]\n",
    "Minute 4: [[2,2,2],\n",
    "           [2,2,0],\n",
    "           [0,2,2]]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]\n",
    "Output: -1\n",
    "Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten,\n",
    "because rotting only happens 4-directionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "Input: grid = [[0,2]]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is 0.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `m == grid.length`\n",
    "- `n == grid[i].length`\n",
    "- `1 <= m, n <= 10`\n",
    "- `grid[i][j]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "## GenAI Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem mirrors propagation patterns in distributed systems, like how updated embeddings spread through a vector database cluster, or how model updates propagate in federated learning.\n",

    "<summary>Hint 3</summary>\n",
    "Count the fresh oranges at the start. If any remain fresh after BFS completes, return -1.\n",
